# Freaky-Friday
In this assignment, you will start by working with another student who will create a description of a website that you will then make. If you consider yourself a beginner to coding, try and find someone who has some experience to pair up with, and vice versa. There are four steps to this assignment. <br>
Step 1: Write a 100-word description or a paper prototype of a website that you would like your partner to create. Remember to use what you learned about communication and expressing yourself clearly when writing your description.<br>
Step 2: Exchange website descriptions or prototypes with your partner and make the website that theyâ€™ve described. You will each then present the website to your partner and then provide feedback to them on the design and functionality. Remember to communicate according to what you have learned about communication when giving and receiving the feedback.<br>
Step 3: If you did not pass the Communication assignment you will also have to reflect on how accurately your partners website is compared to what you had in mind while creating the description. If you have already passed the Communication assignment you may skip this step. Write a 100-word reflection note on you and your partner's communication. Some questions to consider:
-How well did you describe your original idea?-In what ways did your partner fulfill your idea?
-In what ways did your partner exceed your original idea?
-In what ways could you have communicated more clearly?<br>
Step 4: Change your website based on the feedback that you received from your partner.
